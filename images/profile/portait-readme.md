# Portrait Readme

To set the main portrait, rename your chosen image to:

portrait-main.png


and place it in the following path:

../portraits/portrait-main.png


If `portrait-main.png` is not available, the system will fall back to:

portrait-default.png


Make sure both images are located in the same directory.
